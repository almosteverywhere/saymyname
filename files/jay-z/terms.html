Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Website may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Rap Genius may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Website, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Website under any provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Rap Genius may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Website.

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Rap Genius agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. &nbsp;The failure of Rap Genius to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Website or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
