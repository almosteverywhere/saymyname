      <li>Remember to use the proper <a tooltip="&lt;h3 style=&#39;margin-bottom: 5px&#39;&gt;News Genius takes pride in its hygienic texts – please stay in tune with News Genius style:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add interviews, article excerpts, press releases, and related texts with proper formatting:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Identify speakers in interviews with [Name] tags&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Only add &lt;i&gt;excerpts&lt;/i&gt; from outside articles (not the full article) and source the document in the sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add any people or groups discussed as &quot;featured artists&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;See an example &lt;a href=&quot;/Actavis-actavis-to-acquire-warner-chilcott-to-create-premier-s11-billion-revenue-global-specialty-pharmaceutical-company-lyrics&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For very long docs, e.g., government reports, break into individual pages by section. For judicial rulings, break the Syllabus, Opinion, and Ruling into individual pages, like &lt;a href=&quot;/albums/The-supreme-court-of-the-united-states/United-states-v-windsor&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add spaces between paragraphs for clarity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Formatting:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;This text will be bold&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This text will be in italics&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This will create a single space: &amp;amp;nbsp; (use multiple spaces to indent)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add any hyperlinks to source documents or related texts in annotations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the text is in a foreign language, either maintain the proper language formatting or translate/transliterate the document, using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/roman.html&quot;&gt;LoC standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Yeah, I just didn’t think it was the correct venue. If it was something, really like a real problem, you know, I'm not a very difficult to find, especially for someone of that stature.

It's also the case, and this goes back to our other argument, one of the things Republicans have been able to do is cut budgets, so there are a lot fewer police officers in every city in America. And social workers, and other people who might take a preventive kinda situation. And also, by the way, that’s why unemployment is too high; we've created on a private sector jobs, but the Republican priorities have cut over a million have public sector jobs, and that’s cops and others. So they’ve caused that kind of problem by denying the cities the resources that they could use to try to do with the problem.<br>

I agree with that, but that does not mean you don't need police in the short term, and I completely disagree: Stop-and-Frisk is an abuse of people’s rights, but the African Americans I talk to, and that including those in Congress, don't want fewer police--they want better policing. But they want more policing. It’s like Bill said, “Oh, the ambulance came very quickly because you were in a white neighborhood; a sad joke with some truth to it. So denying them the resources is the problem, the notion that because some police have misbehaved you want fewer police. I don't know any significant percentage in the African-American community...<br>
