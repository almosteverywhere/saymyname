    <h2>Tips for editing lyrics</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>To change the lyrics associated with an explanation, move the brackets. <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3480325/screenshots/2010-07-20_1656.swf" target="_blank">Here’s a short video if this is confusing</a></li>
      <li>Remember to use the proper <a tooltip="&lt;h3 style=&#39;margin-bottom: 5px&#39;&gt;Rap Genius takes pride in its hygienic lyrics – please stay in tune with Rap Genius lyric style:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lyric format
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Try to make the song look like a poem&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Put the rapper&#39;s name in brackets above his verse, like: [Verse 2: Lil Wayne]&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;See &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/Eminem-no-love-lyrics&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; for an example of proper formatting&lt;/li
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accurate words
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Avoid cutting off the G in &quot;ing&quot; unless it&#39;s necessary for the rhyme: &lt;i&gt;holding&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;holdin&#39;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grabbing&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;grabbin&#39;&lt;/i&gt;, etc&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use apostrophes when words are shortened: &lt;em&gt;Bangin&#39;&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;Bangin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use &quot;this&quot; not &quot;dis&quot;, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Spellings like &quot;finna&quot;, &quot;trynna&quot;, should only be used when necessary for the rhyme scheme &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

  <div class="description_body"><p>This song is the perfect Song of how LOVE can lead you blind &amp; the strength of it. Look here&rsquo;s how the story goes (Told By Lil Mace)&hellip;</p>

<p>The first verse is him talking to his girl about how he never even meant to be her man but he ended up falling for her anyway. He wanted to leave her because things had gone from great to bad and he decided to leave her because of her jealous ways. She thought he was cheating on her when really he just wanted to be a good man to her but her ways wouldn&rsquo;t let her believe it. So ultimately, he decided to leave her but he couldn&rsquo;t stay away for long because he was so trapped by love that he couldn&rsquo;t leave even if he wanted to. So in the end of the first verse, she doubted 2pac&rsquo;s love for her which drove him away. But since he is such a sucker for love, when he leaves he just can&rsquo;t let her go because he&rsquo;s in love so he&rsquo;s goes back to her.</p>

<p>The 2nd verse is how 2pac&rsquo;s ex told him that she was pregnant and that he was the father. An obvious lie, but he tried to keep it true to her and pick up where he left off but he just couldn&rsquo;t get over the suspicion of her cheating on him. So &lsquo;Pac was constantly doubting his self and the way that she acted. He thinks that she is fooling him just to keep him there. As soon as his girl starts to get phone calls he believes that all of his suspicions were right and that she really was cheating on him. So instead of confronting her about the calls he just decides that she IS cheating and chooses to just disappear from her life. He did that because he felt so used by her and used by love that he realizes once he knows that she&rsquo;s been cheating that he got played by love and it blinded him to go back to her. He was so ashamed of getting played by love that he was sure that he would never let it happen again. In the end of the 2nd verse 'Pac doubted her love for him which drove him away because he felt ashamed that he got played by love and became a sucker for it.</p>

<p>The 3rd verse is Pac talking to his ex about the current relationship that she&rsquo;s in. She is now in a destructive relationship with a man that beats her and doesn&rsquo;t treat her right. He reminds her of what they had before everything started to turn bad. He tells her of all the good things that they had like how he gave her a better life but she threw it all away when she cheated. Even he knows that he was blinded by love and trapped by her, he even admits it. She tells him that she has a man but it&rsquo;s okay if they get back together but she made no move to leave her man and just leaves Pac waiting for an answer to whether or not they could have another try at their relationship. He tells her that all he wanted to do was take away all of her pain, take care of her and treat her right because he is in love with her. All Pac needed was her faith in him and that he would handle all of her problems and show her love. So in the end of the third verse Pac just wants to make his ex happy and give her the life and love that she deservers, but she doubts Pac&rsquo;s love and doesn&rsquo;t put faith in him which keeps her from getting them back together.</p>

<p>So, no matter how much 2pac got played by love he chose to seek it and never give up trying even when was sure that he would give up. He was led blind by love but still chose to follow it. That&rsquo;s why the hook is perfect for this song, the verses are perfect for this song and the production is perfect for this song.</p>
