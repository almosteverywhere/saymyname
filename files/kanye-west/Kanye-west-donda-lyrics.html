    <h2>Tips for editing text</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>To change the text associated with an explanation, move the brackets. <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3480325/screenshots/2010-07-20_1656.swf" target="_blank">Here’s a short video if this is confusing</a></li>
      <li>Remember to use the proper <a tooltip="&lt;h3 style=&#39;margin-bottom: 5px&#39;&gt;News Genius takes pride in its hygienic texts – please stay in tune with News Genius style:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add interviews, article excerpts, press releases, and related texts with proper formatting:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Identify speakers in interviews with [Name] tags&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Only add &lt;i&gt;excerpts&lt;/i&gt; from outside articles (not the full article) and source the document in the sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add any people or groups discussed as &quot;featured artists&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;See an example &lt;a href=&quot;/Actavis-actavis-to-acquire-warner-chilcott-to-create-premier-s11-billion-revenue-global-specialty-pharmaceutical-company-lyrics&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For very long docs, e.g., government reports, break into individual pages by section. For judicial rulings, break the Syllabus, Opinion, and Ruling into individual pages, like &lt;a href=&quot;/albums/The-supreme-court-of-the-united-states/United-states-v-windsor&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add spaces between paragraphs for clarity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Formatting:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;This text will be bold&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
