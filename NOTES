Instinct leads me to another flow
Everytime I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go

notorious big doesn't really use bitch that much, so not such a good metric,
lyrically really good, if someone i'm happy was shot,

describes stuff like this:

Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement (shh)
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (not guilty)

a lot of sexual assault, torture and murder.
how does that even work. if i described this in a song, would not get away with it!
big uses n-word a lot, some songs 15 times
