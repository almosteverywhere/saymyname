Instinct leads me to another flow
Everytime I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go

Instinct leads me to another flow

notorious big doesn't really use bitch that much, so not such a good metric,
lyrically really good, if someone i'm happy was shot,

describes stuff like this:

Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement (shh)
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (not guilty)

a lot of sexual assault, torture and murder.
how does that even work. if i described this in a song, would not get away with it!
big uses n-word a lot, some songs 15 times

dead prez doing not too bad with intelligence is sexy:
Her body and her mind fine
And I can't be no wise guy
But her head game is Einstein

Intelligence is sexy
Sexy, sexy

but some songs about killing white people

but also:

from happiness

I feel great
Even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin'
Feelin' fine
Leavin' my bad times behind
Feels great
